# Website plan: shared current curriculum and GitHub archives

Status: detailed implementation plan. Website tasks below are pending; local operations tooling is implemented separately. Each website slice still requires its groomed issue and independent delivery gates.

All file paths and commands in this document are relative to the website
checkout (`/home/alexey/git/dtc-website`) unless a different repository is named.
New files and CLI entry points listed under a ticket must be implemented by that
ticket before its example verification commands can run. Operations commands
use the separate bootstrap README. Do not execute source conversion or database
commands against production while working through this plan.

Scope: the website side of the LLM Zoomcamp curriculum move, plus the contracts that
the source-repository and operations work must consume. The source repository remains
an external dependency; the cohort bootstrap script and reusable skill are owned by the
parallel operations work.

## Decisions that unblock engineering

These are the decisions to implement unless the owner changes the umbrella issue.

1. **Canonical public hierarchy.** Keep the existing family slug `llm-zoomcamp`.
   Current, shared teaching routes are:

   ```text
   /courses/llm-zoomcamp
   /courses/llm-zoomcamp/01-agentic-rag
   /courses/llm-zoomcamp/01-agentic-rag/01-lesson
   ```

   `01-lesson` is the route-shape fixture; the source's descriptive numbered slug,
   such as `01-retrieval-augmented-generation`, is used in production. The route has
   no `modules`, `lessons`, year, or cohort segment.

   Delivery and operations are explicitly namespaced:

   ```text
   /courses/llm-zoomcamp/cohorts/2026
   /courses/llm-zoomcamp/cohorts/2026/homework/<homework-slug>
   /courses/llm-zoomcamp/cohorts/2026/leaderboard
   /courses/llm-zoomcamp/cohorts/2026/dashboard
   /courses/llm-zoomcamp/cohorts/2026/projects
   /courses/llm-zoomcamp/cohorts/2026/calendar.ics
   ```

   Cohort identifiers are stable slug-like values (`2026`, `spring-2027`,
   `self-paced`); `year` is schedule/display metadata and never the identity.

2. **One current curriculum, not a website version viewer.** Add one database-owned
   current curriculum graph per `Course`: shared modules and lessons are stored once,
   while a cohort stores only its placement/order and optional terminal homework
   mapping. Do not add a public release/version selector or a historical lesson viewer.
   This deliberately supersedes the historical-release proposal in the research notes
   and follows the direct-sync direction in `open-decisions.md` §1. A previous import
   may remain as inactive database rows for rollback/audit, but no route may select it.

3. **Assessment ownership remains cohort-specific.** `Homework`, questions, projects,
   submissions, scores, peer review, leaderboard state, certificates, deadlines, and
   enrollments remain attached to one `Cohort`. A shared lesson links to a selected
   cohort's homework only through an explicit mapping by stable IDs. Never infer an
   assignment from matching numbers, titles, or slugs.

4. **Self-paced phase-one policy.** A v2 manifest with
   `delivery=self_paced` and `curriculum=current` is a first-class context for
   reading, shared lesson progress, and ungraded practice links. Delivery is separate
   from curriculum source: `delivery` has only `live` and `self_paced`; an archive is
   represented by `curriculum=github_archive`, not by an invented archive delivery
   value. Self-paced reading does not invent a deadline, leaderboard, peer-review
   availability, score, certificate, or annual schedule. Do not make
   `Homework.due_date` nullable or alter scoring in this slice. A self-paced cohort
   uses `homework: []` unless an explicitly approved mapping exists; the UI says
   practice is ungraded and offers the shared material rather than manufacturing a
   homework row. Grading/certificate policy remains an owner decision before those
   capabilities are implemented.

5. **Archives are GitHub-only.** A materially different older curriculum (including
   LLM Zoomcamp 2025) is declared with `curriculum=github_archive` and remains in
   `cohorts/<identifier>/` in GitHub with its code, assets, and links. The source
   contract contains only `archive.notice_path` (for example,
   `cohorts/2025/README.md`); the website importer derives and stores the exact
   GitHub blob URL for the Markdown notice from the validated repository URL, incoming full 40-character
   commit SHA, and that path. A manifest must never self-reference a future commit.
   The website may show an archive notice and that exact link on a cohort or mapped
   operational homework page, but it must not parse or render historical lesson
   bodies/assets as a website revision. A closed/archive cohort never redirects to a
   newer assignment.

6. **Explicit family identity.** The public family remains `llm-zoomcamp`; do not
   normalize every repository name into a family slug. Preserve the reviewed mapping in
   `courses/course_family_catalog.py`. The AI Dev Tools exception remains an explicit
   mapping only. Remove the live year-stripping fallback in `Cohort.save()` only after
   every legacy edition has a reviewed mapping and a preflight proves no unmapped row.

7. **Safe context selection.** On a shared module/lesson page, delivery context has
   this precedence: explicit URL context (`?cohort=<identifier>`), a valid remembered
   course preference, the user's sole enrollment, then a chooser. If the user has
   multiple enrollments, never silently choose the newest. An explicit cohort path
   always wins, even when it is closed or differs from the remembered preference.
   Context changes the delivery panel and links only; it never changes the shared lesson
   body or canonical path.

8. **Anonymous and account behavior.** Anonymous readers can read current lessons and
   public assignment statements. Reading or toggling a shared lesson never creates an
   `Enrollment`; authenticated submission/private history requires the explicitly
   selected cohort and an authorized enrollment. A context URL survives login through
   the existing safe local `?next=` mechanism. A copied context URL grants no enrollment.

## Evidence and current implementation boundary

The following repository facts drive the work. They are not optional cleanup items.

| Area | Current evidence | Required consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| URL routing | `courses/urls.py` requires a cohort for module/unit pages and uses two-segment paths; operation routes and legacy edition aliases are interleaved. | Add unambiguous shared paths and `/cohorts/<identifier>` operations. Keep explicit redirect aliases and update all reverse builders. |
| Resolver | `courses/views/url_utils.py` uses `cohort_url_kwargs()` and `get_cohort_or_404()` with a misleading `cohort_year` argument. | Introduce semantic `cohort_identifier` helpers; retain an adapter for old callback kwargs during the transition. |
| Curriculum models | `courses/models/curriculum.py` attaches `Module` to `Cohort`, `Unit` to `Module`, and `UnitReadState` to `Unit`; `Module` requires one terminal cohort homework. | Add separate shared graph and cohort placement/mapping models. Leave old rows and behavior intact for legacy/module cohorts. |
| Importer | `courses/services/curriculum_import.py` duplicates each parsed module/unit into every cohort. | Branch on root shared modules and upsert one shared row per course/content ID; upsert only placement/mapping rows per cohort. Keep `CourseCurriculumImportRun` idempotence and atomic transaction. |
| Parser | `content_sync/course_repository.py` accepts root `module.yaml` but treats it as another module scope; module README/group text is dropped; any `cohorts/<dir>` can become an implicit legacy cohort. | Dispatch v1/v2 explicitly; add root shared scope, numbered-slug validation, explicit `delivery`/`curriculum` fields, and archive `notice_path`. Never infer a website cohort from an arbitrary directory, and never treat an archive descendant as a lesson. |
| Source repository | `llm-zoomcamp` currently has root README stubs and current material under `cohorts/2026`; `cohorts/2025` is a materially different, unmanifested tree. | Move current 2026 material to numbered root folders only after the website checker and dry-run import pass. Keep 2025 opaque and link it by exact commit. |
| Assets | `courses/services/unit_assets.py` points relative images and code at mutable GitHub branch URLs. | Import current relative assets into managed storage with DB rows and stable paths. Archive assets are reached only through the exact GitHub archive link. |
| Assignment view | `courses/views/homework.py` can `get_or_create()` an enrollment while building an authenticated read context. | Change read rendering to a non-creating lookup; create/use enrollment only in the authorized mutation path. |
| Operations | Leaderboard, dashboard, enrollment, project, homework, and calendar queries are already cohort-scoped, but URLs are not explicitly namespaced. | Keep every query scoped to the path's cohort; only change route construction/compatibility wrappers. |
| SEO/cache | `content/public_views.py` courses sitemap lists family pages only; `core/middleware.py` classifies private routes by names and credentials. | Add clean shared module/lesson sitemap records, canonical/robots metadata, and no-store for context-query or operational/private responses. |
| Design | `core/content_page.html` and `courses/tests/test_content_page_shell.py` enforce the page shell. | New shared pages and context/notice panels must use the existing shell and desktop/mobile browser evidence. |

## Specification amendments required before implementation

Open decisions currently disagree with the owner direction and must be amended in a
small documentation ticket before code tickets are selected:

- `_docs/specs/open-decisions.md` §3 currently defers reusable curriculum; record the
  one-current-shared-graph decision, cohort placement/assessment ownership, and the
  self-paced phase-one boundary.
- `_docs/specs/open-decisions.md` §5 currently says no `cohorts/` segment, while
  `_docs/specs/02-url-link-seo-compatibility.md` and the owner require it. Replace the
  no-segment sentence with the exact canonical route table and explicit legacy alias
  policy.
- `_docs/specs/04-courses-and-cohorts.md` must add `shared` curriculum presentation,
  `live`/`self_paced` delivery, `current`/`github_archive` curriculum source,
  archive-only behavior, and preserve the existing `legacy`/`modules` contracts. It
  must explicitly say that no release viewer is part of this slice.
- `_docs/specs/09-migration-rollout-roadmap.md` must add the checker-before-source-move
  gate, shared graph backfill/read-state migration, and rollback/retention behavior.
- `_docs/architecture/database-only-content.md` must document shared curriculum rows
  and managed course assets as the read path; raw GitHub is an import input/archive
  link only.
- `_docs/compatibility/course-route-contracts.json` and the route registry must record
  the old two-segment, old `modules/` lesson, legacy edition-slug, and old-host paths
  as explicit aliases with owner/reason/status. No wildcard redirect is permitted.

## Target data contract

The first schema migration adds these models in `courses/models/shared_curriculum.py`
 and exports them from
`courses/models/__init__.py`. The migration must be additive and run against a
production-like copy before any source move.

### Current shared graph

`SharedCurriculum` is the one current graph for one `Course` (`OneToOneField`,
`PROTECT`/explicit archive transition). It stores source stable ID/content ID/path,
commit, checksum, parser version, and `updated_at`. It is not a version selector and
has no public historical route.

`SharedModule` stores `curriculum`, stable `source_content_id`, numbered `slug`,
`title`, `position`, optional module-overview Markdown and sanitized HTML, optional
summary/group metadata, publication/retirement state, and complete source provenance.
If the source has `README.md`, it may be imported into this separate overview field
as a module index/intro; it is never treated as a `SharedLesson`, and a missing lesson
cannot fall back to README content. Constraints:

- unique `(curriculum, slug)` and `(curriculum, position)`;
- unique `(curriculum, source_content_id)` when present;
- a published module belongs only to the current graph and has a numbered slug;
- retired source rows are retained when learner progress or an alias requires them but
  are absent from current navigation.

`SharedLesson` stores `module`, stable `source_content_id`, numbered `slug`, `title`,
optional summary, `position`, source Markdown, sanitized rendered HTML, video URL,
declared code-source metadata, publication/retirement state, and complete source
provenance. Constraints mirror `SharedModule` for `(module, slug)`, `(module,
position)`, and source content ID. Stable source IDs are the identity; positions and
titles may change only through an explicit import/alias check.

`CohortSharedModule` is the delivery placement: `cohort`, `shared_module`, delivery
position, and nullable `terminal_homework` (`PROTECT`). It is unique by cohort/module
and cohort/position. A validation query/service rejects a module whose curriculum's
course differs from the cohort's course and a homework from another cohort. A
self-paced placement may have no homework.

Do not add a new shared project-flow model in this slice. Existing v1 project flow stays intact for v1 deliveries. V2 current modules use root numeric order; cohort projects remain accessible through their existing operational pages. Interleaving projects into a v2 learning path requires an explicit source-contract extension before implementation, not an inferred project order.

`SharedLessonReadState` is `(user, shared_lesson, read_at)` with a unique constraint on
the pair. A data migration copies the earliest `read_at` for each stable source content
ID from old `UnitReadState` rows; it does not silently merge different source IDs.
Old `Unit`/`UnitReadState` rows remain during the rollback/audit window and are not used
by shared public reads after cutover.

### Assets and links

`SharedCurriculumAsset` stores the owning lesson (or module overview), repository
relative source path, safe stable public path, managed-storage key, content type, byte
size, checksum, and complete source provenance. The storage key includes source stable
ID, full commit SHA, and checksum, so an import cannot overwrite bytes currently being
served. The stable public path is a DB lookup, not a GitHub branch URL. Reuse the
existing media-store abstraction where possible; do not attach course rows to the
rejected generic `ContentRelease` graph solely to obtain asset storage.

The importer validates and stores relative image/code references from the same
snapshot. Absolute external HTTPS references remain subject to the existing sanitizer
and are never rewritten; missing/escaping relative references reject the import. The
asset endpoint reads the row and managed store only. It never fetches GitHub during a
request. Cleanup of an uncommitted object is an import-job concern and must not expose
its key in logs.

`CurriculumRouteAlias` stores an explicit old path, target kind, reason, source
commit and active flag. Its target is exactly one of a shared module, a shared
lesson, or a GitHub archive destination attached to a cohort. For the archive
case, store a validated repository-relative path under that cohort archive;
derive the HTTPS GitHub URL from the trusted repository identity and imported
commit. Use `blob/<sha>/<path>` for a Markdown notice/lesson file and
`tree/<sha>/<path>` for a directory. Never accept an arbitrary external redirect
URL. This permits old historical lesson links to reach matching archived files
without creating historical website lessons. Reject collisions, loops, missing
targets, retirement without replacement, and reusing an old path for different
content. Import does not infer aliases from titles or numeric positions.

### Cohort additions

Extend `Cohort` with the database equivalents of the v2 manifest discriminators:

- `curriculum_format` choice `shared` in addition to existing `legacy`/`modules`;
- `delivery_mode` choices only `live` and `self_paced`, defaulting existing rows to
  `live` without changing their schedule;
- `curriculum_source` choices `current` and `github_archive`, defaulting existing
  rows to `current` while their legacy/module format remains supported during the
  transition;
- `shared_curriculum` nullable FK to `SharedCurriculum`, used only for
  `curriculum_format=shared` and validated to belong to the cohort's course;
- `archive_notice_path` nullable repository-relative POSIX path plus generated
  `archive_url` and `archive_commit_sha` (full lowercase SHA). These three are
  required for `curriculum_source=github_archive`; the importer derives the latter
  two from the validated incoming repository URL and commit and the manifest's
  `archive.notice_path`. They are absent for `curriculum_source=current`.

`curriculum_source=github_archive` is orthogonal to delivery, so a historical cohort
may retain `delivery_mode=live`; it has no shared module/lesson placement. A source
`curriculum=current` maps to the shared graph for v2, while old v1 rows retain their
existing `legacy`/`modules` format until an explicit migration. Add model/service
validation for the allowed combinations; do not overload `delivery_mode` with an
`archive` value.

The adapter must use this one-way mapping (and expose it in its diagnostics):

| v2 manifest field | Website projection |
| --- | --- |
| `delivery` | `Cohort.delivery_mode` (`live` or `self_paced`) |
| `curriculum: current` | `Cohort.curriculum_source=current`, `curriculum_format=shared`, and the course's `SharedCurriculum` pointer |
| `curriculum: github_archive` | `Cohort.curriculum_source=github_archive`, no shared placement, and archive notice/derived URL fields |
| homework `{module: root-slug, source}` | one cohort-owned `Homework` plus the matching `CohortSharedModule.terminal_homework` binding |
| archive homework `{module: null, source}` | one cohort-owned operational `Homework` with no shared-module binding |
| `archive.notice_path` | `archive_notice_path`; importer derives/stores `archive_url` and `archive_commit_sha` |

There is no reverse inference from database year, folder name, title, or homework slug
back into a v2 mapping.

Do not rename or delete `slug`, `uuid`, legacy numeric IDs, homework/project foreign
keys, enrollment rows, submissions, scores, or certificates. Do not change
`Homework.due_date` in this work. Keep the reviewed family mapping explicit and remove
`Cohort.save()`'s regex fallback in a separately audited step only after preflight.

## Interfaces and invariants

### Context service

Add `courses/services/course_context.py` with a pure, testable result such as:

```python
DeliveryContext(
    course: Course,
    cohort: Cohort | None,
    enrollment: Enrollment | None,
    source: Literal["explicit", "remembered", "sole_enrollment", "chooser", "invalid"],
    explicit: bool,
    has_multiple_enrollments: bool,
    invalid_identifier: str | None,
)
```

`resolve_delivery_context(request, course, explicit_identifier=None)` must:

- parse exactly one bounded ASCII `cohort` query value; duplicate, empty, malformed,
  or unknown explicit values never fall back;
- validate a remembered session preference against the course and visible/allowed
  cohort before using it; session writes are keyed by course slug and never by email;
- use a sole enrollment only when there is exactly one eligible cohort;
- return chooser state for zero or multiple choices; never select newest implicitly;
- preserve the selected context in same-tab shared links, previous/next, module/homework
  links, and login `next` values;
- set `request.private_response_required` for query/session/authenticated context that
  varies the representation, so `ResponsePolicyMiddleware` cannot share it. A clean,
  context-free anonymous lesson can remain public-cache eligible.

An explicit `/cohorts/<identifier>/...` operation resolves directly from the path and
never consults this default resolver. Missing cohort or missing mapping is a bounded
404/chooser error, not a newest-cohort fallback.

### URL builders and aliases

Update `courses/views/url_utils.py` with semantic builders:

- `course_family_url(course)`;
- `shared_module_url(module)`;
- `shared_lesson_url(lesson, *, cohort=None)`;
- `cohort_url(cohort, route_name="cohort", **kwargs)`;
- `legacy_course_alias_url(...)` for compatibility tests only.

`cohort_url_kwargs()` may remain temporarily for copied callbacks, but its adapter must
map one semantic identifier and all generated URLs must use the canonical
`cohorts/<identifier>` path. Mechanical callers include
`courses/views/{course,course_aliases,course_calendar,course_enrollment,course_leaderboard,
dashboard,homework,homework_statistics,homework_submissions,module,project,project_eval,
project_eval_actions,project_results,project_statistics,project_submissions,unit}.py`,
`courses/services/member_home.py`, wrapped/deadline/confirmation services, and all
templates using `url` tags.

Canonical route names should remain available to copied services (`course`, `homework`,
`leaderboard`, `dashboard`, `project`, `module`, `unit`, etc.) but reverse to the new
paths with `cohort_identifier`. Give redirect-only aliases distinct names. A route
converter must not treat `year` as a numeric-only value.

### Import command

Extend `CourseRepositorySource`, `ModuleSource`, `CohortSource`, and
`CurriculumImportCommand` in `courses/services/curriculum_source.py` and
`courses/services/curriculum_import.py` with:

- explicit module scope (`shared` or `cohort`), optional module-overview metadata,
  stable source IDs, and explicit v2 cohort fields (`delivery`, `curriculum`,
  `archive.notice_path`, and a list of `{module, source}` homework bindings);
- root shared module import exactly once per source content ID;
- cohort placement and assignment binding import by stable IDs;
- `curriculum=github_archive` suppression before descendant discovery, with only
  `archive.notice_path` and explicitly mapped `module: null` homework exposed to the
  projection;
- source-scoped soft-retirement for removed shared rows; preserve read/assessment
  evidence and fail closed on a submitted homework/module change;
- the existing `CourseCurriculumImportRun` state/count/diagnostic contract, source
  commit identity, atomic transaction, and replay behavior.

The importer may update DB-owned current content in place after parser validation. It
must not render from a checkout or call GitHub from a view. A failed import leaves all
previous current rows, mappings, and assets visible. A successful import invalidates
the course/module/lesson public cache keys and records counts using user IDs only in
logs (never email addresses).

### Assignment and auth invariant

Change `courses/views/homework.py` and its context helpers so GET/HEAD display uses
`Enrollment.objects.filter(...).first()` and never `get_or_create()`. Submission,
enrollment toggle, project mutations, score breakdown, and private history continue to
require the path's exact cohort and authenticated permission. Add explicit tests for an
authenticated non-enrolled reader, a user enrolled in two cohorts, and a copied URL
whose cohort differs from the remembered preference.

## Staged implementation tickets

The tickets below are intentionally bounded so each can be assigned to one engineer and
independently tested. They are ordered by dependency; a later ticket must not move the
source repository ahead of the checker gate.

### W0 — Amend the contracts and freeze the route map

**Dependencies:** none. **Owner:** website PM/spec maintainer.

**Files:** `_docs/specs/open-decisions.md`,
`_docs/specs/02-url-link-seo-compatibility.md`, `_docs/specs/04-courses-and-cohorts.md`,
`_docs/specs/09-migration-rollout-roadmap.md`,
`_docs/architecture/database-only-content.md`,
`_docs/compatibility/course-route-contracts.json`,
`_docs/compatibility/` route/redirect manifest, and a focused contract test under
`content/tests/` or `courses/tests/`.

**Deliverables:** record the decisions above; classify every current course route and
alias; define canonical/redirect/no-store/noindex expectations; document that GitHub
archives are opaque website links; define exact archive URL validation; record the
route kwarg compatibility window. No implementation code or source move belongs here.

**Acceptance/tests:** a contract test fails for an unclassified route, a wildcard
redirect, an archive URL containing a branch, or a canonical shared URL containing a
cohort query. Review the manifest against `courses/urls.py` and the copied-host route
inventory.

**Command:**

```text
uv run --frozen pytest content/tests/test_route_contracts.py content/tests/test_canonical_routes.py -q
```

### W1 — Build the parser/layout checker before changing GitHub

**Dependencies:** W0. **Owner:** website/content-sync engineer.

**Files:** `content_sync/course_repository.py`,
`content_sync/course_repository_ingest.py`,
`content_sync/course_repository_registration.py`,
`content_sync/course_repository_sources.json`,
`courses/services/curriculum_source.py`,
`content_sync/tests/test_course_repository.py`,
`content_sync/tests/test_course_repository_transport_parity.py`, new pure layout/checker
module (for example `content_sync/course_repository_layout.py`), its tests, and a new
fixture under `content_sync/tests/fixtures/course_repository/llm_zoomcamp_shared/`.

**Contract:** dispatch on the root `course.yaml:schema_version`. Keep schema 1 on its
existing parser and projection unchanged; schema 2 accepts only numbered root module
directories (`NN-kebab/module.yaml`) and numbered lesson Markdown listed by the module
manifest. `README.md` is a GitHub module index and may be exposed as a separate,
optional module overview/intro, but is never a lesson or a fallback for a missing
lesson. Validate explicitly declared relative assets/code and module-local paths.

For schema 2, discover cohort manifests only at `cohorts/<id>/cohort.yaml`. A current
cohort has `delivery: live|self_paced`, `curriculum: current`, and a list of explicit
homework bindings `{module: <root-module-slug>, source: <full repo-relative path>}`;
`homework: []` is valid. Classify an archive cohort first: its
`curriculum: github_archive` record contains only `archive.notice_path` plus optional
explicit homework bindings whose `module` is `null`; the complete descendant tree is
opaque GitHub content. Archive module/unit IDs are ignored, while explicitly mapped
archive homework/question IDs register as cohort-owned operational data. A current
mapping cannot point into `cohorts/`, and every mapped source must resolve under its
declaring cohort. Existing legacy/module layouts remain accepted for other sources
during the transition; v1 is never silently reinterpreted as v2.

Add one versioned, test-only known-output fixture (for example
`content_sync/tests/fixtures/course_repository/llm_zoomcamp_shared/expected-v2.json`)
whose schema is the parser's normalized output: course identity, one list of root
shared modules/lessons, explicit cohort records (`identifier`, `delivery`,
`curriculum`, archive notice), and explicit homework bindings. The checker, bootstrap
contract tests, and website importer tests must all consume this same fixture/output
schema; do not maintain three independent sample formats. It is test data only and
must never be a runtime content fallback.

The fixture contract is intentionally concrete so later consumers do not invent a
second shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "course": {"content_id": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111", "slug": "llm-zoomcamp"},
  "modules": [{
    "scope": "shared",
    "content_id": "22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222",
    "slug": "01-agentic-rag",
    "lessons": [{"content_id": "33333333-3333-4333-8333-333333333333", "slug": "01-lesson", "path": "01-lesson.md"}]
  }],
  "cohorts": [
    {"identifier": "2026", "delivery": "live", "curriculum": "current",
     "homework": [{"module": "01-agentic-rag", "source": "cohorts/2026/homework/01-agentic-rag/homework.yaml"}]},
    {"identifier": "self-paced", "delivery": "self_paced", "curriculum": "current", "homework": []},
    {"identifier": "2025", "delivery": "live", "curriculum": "github_archive",
     "archive": {"notice_path": "cohorts/2025/README.md"},
     "homework": [{"module": null, "source": "cohorts/2025/01-old-module/homework.yaml"}]}
  ]
}
```

The real fixture uses UUIDs/checksums and the parser's typed output, but retains these
keys and semantics. `archive` never contains a commit supplied by the source; the
import report adds the validated incoming commit and derived URL.

**Checker interface:** add a no-network command such as
`uv run --frozen python scripts/verify_course_repository_curriculum.py --checkout
<path> --commit <full-sha> --json .tmp/course-content-research/layout-report.json`.
It must run `git archive` for the specified commit, inspect tar metadata and parser
output without importing/executing notebooks or code, and report counts/paths/checksums
without file contents or PII. It fails on root stubs, unnumbered module/lesson slugs,
duplicate stable IDs, unsafe/missing references, ambiguous aliases, archive branch-tip
URLs, malformed manifests, archive module mappings, out-of-cohort homework paths,
mixed live manifest versions, and parser/import contract drift. It must prove that a
complete archive subtree contributes zero module/unit records and that an explicitly
mapped archive homework contributes only a cohort homework record.

**Admission bounds:** preserve the shared compressed archive ceiling (`MAX_ARCHIVE_BYTES`
200,000,000), source decompressed ceilings (`max_files`, `max_total_bytes`,
`max_file_bytes`), YAML bounds, and path/symlink checks. Measure both before admitting
expanded current assets; the present `llm-zoomcamp` archive is about 28.5 MB and must
remain below the registered source's 100 MB/5,000-file limits after the move. Do not
raise limits merely to admit duplicated current material. Make `ContentSource.path_allowlist`
effective or explicitly document/implement the shared admission function so push and
pull transports cannot disagree.

**Acceptance/tests:** the known-output fixture yields one `shared` module graph, one
live current cohort, one self-paced current cohort, and one `github_archive` cohort;
the same root module source ID is represented once even when both current cohorts
reference it; archive module/unit IDs are absent while a mapped `module: null`
homework ID is present; 2025-like files do not create a website lesson; archive and
checkout transport tests apply identical bounds; `--help` and dry-run output are
deterministic.

**Commands:**

```text
uv run --frozen pytest content_sync/tests/test_course_repository.py content_sync/tests/test_course_repository_transport_parity.py content_sync/tests/test_course_repository_registration.py -q
uv run --frozen python scripts/verify_course_repository_curriculum.py --help
```

### W2 — Add the shared graph schema and safe backfill service

**Dependencies:** W0 (contract), W1 (stable parser shape). **Owner:** website courses
model engineer.

**Files:** new `courses/models/shared_curriculum.py`,
`courses/models/cohort.py`, `courses/models/__init__.py`,
`courses/migrations/0005_shared_current_curriculum.py` (name may follow the generated
migration sequence), new `courses/services/migrate_shared_curriculum.py`,
`courses/tests/test_shared_curriculum_models.py`, and migration/preflight tests.

**Deliverables:** create the models and constraints in the data contract; add
`CurriculumFormat.SHARED`, `Cohort.delivery_mode` (`live|self_paced`),
`Cohort.curriculum_source` (`current|github_archive`), the shared curriculum relation,
and archive notice/derived URL fields. Add an explicit `--dry-run`/`--apply` backfill
service that reads the existing LLM 2026 cohort-owned Module/Unit rows by source
content ID, creates one shared graph, creates placements/mappings, copies earliest read
timestamps, and leaves all old rows, homework, projects, submissions, scores,
enrollments, and certificates untouched. It must stop with a bounded conflict report
when two rows with one stable ID have different content/provenance; no fuzzy title or
year matching. A v2 archive cohort creates no shared placement; only an explicitly
mapped archive homework is eligible for projection, with `module=null`.

**Acceptance/tests:** database constraints reject duplicate positions/source IDs, invalid discriminator combinations, and missing required archive fields. Model/service validation rejects cross-course placements and cross-cohort homework bindings before writes; tests must exercise those service boundaries, since ordinary Django check constraints cannot join foreign-key tables.
Backfill dry-run is repeatable, apply is idempotent, and a failed conflict changes no
rows. Existing rows retain IDs/history and are not silently relabeled as archive or
self-paced. Empty databases still have no public content; runtime never reads a
fixture or source checkout.

### W3 — Import one shared graph and managed current assets

**Dependencies:** W1 parser contract, W2 schema/backfill. **Owner:** website content-sync
engineer.

**Files:** `courses/services/curriculum_import.py`,
`courses/services/curriculum_source.py`, `courses/models/shared_curriculum.py`,
`courses/services/unit_assets.py` (or its shared replacement),
`courses/services/unit_links.py`, `content_sync/course_repository_ingest.py`,
`courses/tests/test_curriculum_import_service.py`,
`courses/tests/test_shared_curriculum_import.py`, asset-store tests, and import fixtures.

**Deliverables:** branch the existing importer for root shared modules. Consume the
parser's known-output schema and upsert one `SharedModule`/`SharedLesson` per source
stable ID, including optional module overview/group metadata, sanitized HTML, video/code
metadata and managed assets. Upsert per-cohort placement, terminal-homework mapping
by stable IDs; retain existing project operational records. For `curriculum=github_archive`, persist the cohort's
`archive_notice_path` and derive `archive_url` from the validated repository URL,
incoming full commit SHA, and notice path; do not create shared module/unit rows. An
explicit archive homework binding with `module: null` may create/update only its
cohort-owned homework/questions. Keep legacy/module cohort projection unchanged.
Source-scoped removals retire unreferenced shared rows instead of deleting rows needed
by read state/aliases; submitted cohort assessments retain their existing protection
checks. Keep import runs replayable by source/commit/parser, atomic, and failure-safe.

**Acceptance/tests:** two current cohorts reference the same database lesson/module
primary key; editing current Markdown updates the one shared row and not an old/archive
cohort; a changed source slug with unchanged ID requires an explicit alias; a missing
assignment mapping never selects another cohort's homework; a complete archive fixture
creates zero module/unit rows while an explicitly mapped `module: null` homework is
registered; the archive URL contains the incoming full SHA and validated notice path;
failed asset upload/import does not expose a public row; no request reads GitHub/raw
branch URLs. Current relative images resolve to the managed stable path, external HTTPS
links remain external, and historical lesson files are not imported.

**Commands:**

```

### W4 — Implement shared views, context, and namespaced operations

**Dependencies:** W2 schema; W3 import interface. **Owner:** website route/courses
engineer.

**Files:** `courses/urls.py`, `courses/views/url_utils.py`, new
`courses/services/course_context.py`, new shared view module(s),
`courses/views/course.py`, `courses/views/module.py`, `courses/views/unit.py`,
`courses/views/homework.py`, `courses/views/course_page_context.py`,
`courses/views/course_aliases.py`, and every reverse-builder/callsite listed in the URL
interface section. Add focused route/context tests under `courses/tests/`.

**Canonical routes:** add shared family/module/lesson views and `/cohorts/<identifier>`
operation routes. Existing route names used by copied services reverse to the new
canonical destinations. Add explicit redirect-only routes for:

- old `/courses/<family>/<identifier>` cohort pages and all old operation children;
- old `/courses/<family>/<identifier>/modules/<module>/<lesson>` pages;
- legacy edition slugs (`/courses/llm-zoomcamp-2026/...` and recorded root aliases);
- known `courses.datatalks.club` HTML compatibility paths, subject to the existing
  host/API migration contract.

GET/HEAD aliases redirect once with the raw query preserved. Existing mutation routes keep direct compatibility adapters with the same path-cohort authorization until their clients are migrated; never redirect a submission or replace a working POST endpoint with 405 as a side effect of moving HTML routes. Routes that were already read-only retain their 405/Allow behavior. Unknown/malformed identifiers are
real 404s. Redirect targets are generated from reviewed mappings, never year stripping.

**Context/auth behavior:** shared module footer and lesson panel show selected cohort,
mapped homework title/deadline/status and fully qualified operation URL when available;
without context they show an explicit chooser. Preserve query context in next/previous,
module, homework and login links. A selected 2025 archive operation always remains in
2025; a selected 2026 operation never leaks into it. Anonymous GET never creates an
enrollment. Private mutation views continue exact cohort authorization.

**Acceptance/tests:** cover zero/one/multiple enrollment, two browser tabs with different
contexts, direct wrong-cohort links, invalid explicit context, missing mapping, closed
archive cohort, login return with query, anonymous read, authenticated non-enrolled read,
and submission denial/allowance. Existing scoring/project/leaderboard tests retain their
cohort isolation and legacy IDs.

**Commands:**

```text
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=website.settings.test uv run --frozen python manage.py test courses.tests.test_course_cohort_split courses.tests.test_course_url_trailing_slash courses.tests.test_course_family_navigation courses.tests.test_shared_course_routes courses.tests.test_course_context courses.tests.test_homework courses.tests.test_course_leaderboard --noinput
```

### W5 — Render the shared pages, archive notice, SEO and cache contract

**Dependencies:** W4 routes/context, W3 stored HTML/assets. **Owner:** website frontend/
SEO engineer.

**Files:** `courses/templates/courses/course_family.html`,
`courses/templates/courses/course.html`, existing or new
`courses/templates/courses/module.html`/`unit.html` plus shared variants,
`courses/templates/courses/_module_rail.html`, new context/chooser/archive partials,
`courses/registration.py` only if renderer helpers need a safe seam,
`core/middleware.py`, `content/public_views.py`, `content/public_routes.py`,
`content/tests/test_courses_sitemap_contract.py`, route/SEO tests, and
`courses/tests/test_content_page_shell.py` updates.

**Deliverables:** use `core/content_page.html` and the existing design system. Shared
module pages show overview/grouped numbered lessons once; shared lessons show title,
video, body, managed images/code links, read control, context panel and next/previous
links. Archive cohorts/homework show a clear “older curriculum” notice and exact GitHub
archive link, never old lesson body. Self-paced UI says “practice/progress” and omits
deadline/competitive claims.

Clean shared paths self-canonical and are eligible for the anonymous public course/detail
cache only when no context or credential varies them. Context query/session,
authenticated state, operations, homework, leaderboard, dashboard, submissions,
enrollment, and archive/private state set `private, no-store` and `X-Robots-Tag` where
the route policy requires. Development remains `noindex, nofollow`.

The courses sitemap contains `/courses`, visible family pages, published current shared
module and lesson paths, only. Cohort landing pages remain outside the initial sitemap. It excludes query-context URLs, old redirects, homework/leaderboard/
dashboard/private children, and GitHub archives. Canonical, Open Graph, breadcrumb and
internal links never emit a cohort-specific lesson path.

**Acceptance/tests:** page shell test passes; canonical/query/robots/cache tests cover
GET/HEAD/POST, credential cookies, session context and `?cohort`; sitemap has no query,
archive, private or redirect locations; managed images load without GitHub requests;
desktop 1440px and mobile 390px browser screenshots show no overflow, duplicate rail,
missing context, or error page.

**Commands:**

```text
uv run --frozen pytest courses/tests/test_content_page_shell.py content/tests/test_courses_sitemap_contract.py content/tests/test_public_routes_and_seo.py courses/tests/test_shared_course_seo.py -q
make test-playwright-core
```

### W6 — Compatibility, migration audit, and consumer parity

**Dependencies:** W4/W5; W0 route manifest. **Owner:** website compatibility/data engineer.

**Files:** `_docs/compatibility/course-route-contracts.json`, route registry and
redirect tests, `courses/views/course_aliases.py`, `courses/views/url_utils.py`, copied
API/management serializers if they embed course URLs, deadline/reminder/member-home/
confirmation builders, certificate/calendar URL helpers, and migration/preflight
reports.

**Deliverables:** mechanically inventory `reverse("course"/"module"/"unit"/operation)`
and template URL tags; update generated links while preserving API field names and
legacy numeric/UUID IDs. Produce a deterministic old-to-new path report and one-hop
redirect tests. Preserve ICS UID suffixes and query strings. Confirm external
`courses.datatalks.club` compatibility routes remain available until their declared
cutover; do not redirect API requests through HTML Lambda behavior.

**Acceptance/tests:** all known legacy route examples resolve to one reviewed final or
real 404; no generated page contains the old two-segment canonical; all operation forms
post to the selected cohort; old calendar/event UIDs and assessment IDs remain stable;
existing mutation adapters preserve behavior and do not redirect. Run the route inventory checker and copied course/API
characterization suite.

**Commands:**

```text
uv run --frozen pytest courses/tests/test_course_url_trailing_slash.py courses/tests/test_course_links.py content/tests/test_route_contracts.py -q
rg -n 'reverse\(("|\x27)(course|module|unit|homework|leaderboard|dashboard)' courses scripts content_sync
```

### W7 — Dry-run/backfill the website before source movement

**Dependencies:** W1, W2, W3, W4, W6. **Owner:** website release/data operator with
independent checker.

**Files:** `scripts/verify_course_repository_curriculum.py`,
`courses/services/migrate_shared_curriculum.py`, import fixtures/reports under `.tmp/`,
and runbook documentation under `_docs/runbooks/`.

**Deliverables:** against a production-like database copy, run schema migration, shared
graph dry-run, old read-state reconciliation, and exact current-source parse/import in
one report. First inventory **every** current-linked cohort for `llm-zoomcamp`, including
live and self-paced rows: identifier, delivery, curriculum source, mapped homework,
enrollment count, submitted-assessment count, stable module/lesson IDs and route
aliases. For each row, record an operator-reviewed decision to remain
`curriculum=current` (shared graph) or become `curriculum=github_archive`; an ongoing
self-paced cohort cannot be archived or have its assignment prerequisites changed by
silence. A new self-paced delivery gets a new identifier; never reuse an identifier to
erase old history. Compare counts and checksums: module/lesson identities, homework
bindings, asset manifest, route aliases, legacy IDs, submissions/enrollments, and cache
invalidation intents. Apply only after an independent reviewer confirms no conflicting
stable IDs, no submitted assessment would be changed, no 2025 body is imported, and
the generated archive URL points to a full commit. Keep a rollback procedure that
restores route readers/old rows without deleting new rows. Distinguish a no-copy new
current delivery from the separate archive operation in the report and approval.

**Acceptance/tests:** replay is idempotent; every current-linked live/self-paced cohort
has an explicit keep/archive decision; a forced parser/import/asset failure leaves the
pre-run current graph visible; old and new route smoke requests agree on content or
the recorded redirect; shared lesson primary keys are reused by live and self-paced
placements; archive conversion preserves cohort/homework/submission/enrollment IDs and
creates no module/unit rows; a new self-paced cohort has no copied lessons and no
fabricated deadlines; no private data appears in the report.

**Commands:**

```text
uv run --frozen python scripts/verify_course_repository_curriculum.py --checkout .tmp/course-checkouts/llm-zoomcamp --commit <full-sha> --dry-run
uv run --frozen python manage.py migrate --noinput
uv run --frozen python manage.py migrate_shared_curriculum --course llm-zoomcamp --dry-run
uv run --frozen pytest courses/tests/test_shared_curriculum_import.py content_sync/tests/test_course_repository_transport_parity.py -q
```

### W8 — Move the LLM source tree, preserving 2025 archive content

**Dependencies:** W7 independent pass and green W1 checker. **Owner:** LLM Zoomcamp
repository owner, coordinated with website importer.

**Source changes (in `/home/alexey/git/llm-zoomcamp`, not this repository):**

- replace root `01-agentic-rag` … `07-project-example` README stubs with the current
  module manifests, module overviews, numbered lessons, code, and images currently
  under `cohorts/2026/<module>/`; move rather than copy current material so the source
  archive does not multiply it;
- preserve each existing module/lesson stable content ID and descriptive numbered slug;
  a rename adds an explicit alias in the manifest before the move;
- update `cohorts/2026/cohort.yaml` to schema 2 with
  `delivery: live`, `curriculum: current`, and explicit root-module-to-homework
  bindings; add any approved self-paced cohort manifest with
  `delivery: self_paced`, `curriculum: current`, the same root module graph and
  `homework: []` (or only explicitly approved mappings), never a copied lesson tree;
- preserve every historical file under `cohorts/2025/` intact and available for
  GitHub navigation; add only the v2 cohort manifest/README notice needed to describe
  that archive. Its manifest uses `delivery: live`, `curriculum: github_archive`, and
  only `archive.notice_path` plus optional explicit `module: null` homework bindings.
  Historical module manifests/lessons/assets may remain in that subtree as opaque
  GitHub content; they must not be discovered or projected by the website parser. Do
  not put a future commit SHA in the manifest; derive the final URL after the commit
  is created;
- run the checker against the exact commit and record the bounded archive/file counts.

The website importer consumes the commit only after the checker report, parser replay,
asset manifest and route smoke pass. It must never execute source notebooks/scripts or
read source files during a request.

**Acceptance/tests:** a fresh GitHub checkout has working root numbered links and
working 2025 archive links; `git diff --find-renames` shows current content moved, not
duplicated; the website displays one shared current graph and a 2025 archive notice;
the exact 2025 archive URL resolves at the recorded full SHA.

**Commands:**

```text
git -C /home/alexey/git/llm-zoomcamp archive --format=tar <full-sha> | wc -c
uv run --frozen python scripts/verify_course_repository_curriculum.py --checkout /home/alexey/git/llm-zoomcamp --commit <full-sha> --json .tmp/course-content-research/llm-zoomcamp-layout.json
uv run --frozen pytest content_sync/tests/test_course_repository.py courses/tests/test_shared_curriculum_import.py -q
```

### W9 — Connect the cohort bootstrap script and reusable operations skill

**Dependencies:** W2 data contract, W4 route/context contract, W7 dry-run, and the
parallel operations deliverable. **Owner:** operations agent (parent scope), with a
website consumer review.

**Website-facing contract:** the script/skill writes cohort source files only. The website importer subsequently creates or updates a `Cohort` with an
explicit course-family mapping, identifier, `delivery: live|self_paced`,
`curriculum: current|github_archive`, shared curriculum pointer when current, archive
notice metadata when applicable, and stable cohort-to-module-to-homework IDs. It must
not duplicate shared modules/lessons, copy learner state, infer identity from year
stripping, or overwrite existing assessment history. `self_paced` creation leaves due
dates/competitive state unset and is clearly labeled. Archive source creation stores the
validated notice path; website import derives and stores the exact GitHub commit URL, creates no lesson graph, and
may bind only explicitly mapped `module: null` operational homework. A no-copy new
self-paced delivery and archiving an old delivery are separate explicit operations.

**Acceptance:** website route smoke can consume a script-created live, self-paced and
archive fixture whose normalized output matches the single W1 known-output fixture;
repeated bootstrap is idempotent; a conflicting stable ID or assignment mapping fails
before mutation; the script's redacted report uses user IDs only.

### W10 — Cutover and independent verification gates

**Dependencies:** W8 and W9; all prior tests green. **Owner:** engineer, then independent
tester and PM per `_docs/PROCESS.md`.

**Engineer gate:** freeze base/head, generate the versioned selective verification plan,
run migrations/django checks and focused Django tests, record import/checker reports,
and leave the worktree uncommitted. No production conversion/deployment occurs in this
plan.

**Tester gate:** independently recompute the plan, run focused Django plus
`make test-playwright-core` (or `make test-playwright` if the changed harness/template
classification requires it), inspect desktop/mobile screenshots under `.tmp/screenshots/`,
and test anonymous, multi-enrollment, wrong-cohort, login-return, closed/archive,
missing-mapping and mutation compatibility and read-only method-denial behavior. Required screenshots cannot be pending.

**PM gate:** check every component exactly once, including route/canonical copy, empty
and error states, permissions, archive notice, responsive navigation and absence of
historical on-site lesson rendering. Only after both gates may the orchestrator merge/
push under the process rules.

```

No source-repository move (W8) is allowed while W1 or W7 is failing. W9 may be developed
in parallel after its contract is frozen, but its fixture cannot be accepted until W4
consumes it.

## Failure, security, and observability requirements

- Parser/import errors expose stable bounded diagnostic codes and source paths only;
  never Markdown, notebook contents, answer keys, credentials, or email addresses.
- GitHub webhooks and local pulls use the same tar reader, path/symlink policy, archive
  ceiling, file count, total bytes, YAML bounds, and parser. A source-specific limit may
  narrow but never widen the default.
- Source archive links are derived only after validating an HTTPS GitHub repository,
  full lowercase incoming commit SHA, cohort-relative `notice_path`, and a GitHub blob URL for the Markdown notice (or tree URL for an archive directory)
  that contains that exact SHA/path. Branch names (`main`, `master`) and
  self-referential future SHAs are rejected for archive identity. Archive content is
  never imported into current shared rows.
- Public requests query only published/current database rows and managed assets. There
  is no request-time GitHub fetch, filesystem Markdown fallback, checked-in JSON content
  fallback, notebook execution, or source-code import.
- Context/query/session/authenticated variants set `private_response_required` and
  `private, no-store`; public clean shared pages carry the same canonical/robots/asset
  representation on cache hit and miss. Cache keys never include arbitrary cookies,
  enrollment state, or email.
- Every mutation logs course/cohort/assignment stable IDs, request/correlation ID and
  user ID where allowed; never log email addresses or learner names. Import counts,
  checksum, commit and replay status are persisted in `CourseCurriculumImportRun`.
- Import success invalidates shared lesson/module/family and affected operations caches;
  failure leaves old rows and cache entries untouched. Asset cleanup is retryable and
  does not make an uncommitted public path resolvable.

## Required verification matrix

| Component | Minimum evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Models/migrations | `make migrations-check`; `make test-migrations`; model constraints and backfill dry-run/idempotence tests |
| Parser/transport | parser fixtures, push/pull parity, archive bounds, numbered paths, archive-only non-import, no execution |
| Import | shared primary-key reuse, stable-ID/alias behavior, protected assessment/read state, atomic failure, asset checksum/path |
| Routes/compatibility | canonical shared and `/cohorts/` paths, one-hop old aliases, legacy edition map, direct mutation compatibility/read-only 405, exact query preservation |
| Context/auth | anonymous read/no enrollment, sole vs multiple enrollment, explicit precedence, tab isolation, login return, wrong/missing/closed cohort |
| Operations | homework/project/leaderboard/dashboard/calendar exact cohort; no cross-cohort state or URL generation |
| SEO/cache/sitemap | canonical, metadata, robots, query no-store, credential no-store, sitemap inclusion/exclusion, public cache TTL class |
| UI/accessibility | content page shell, grouped module overview, single rail, read toggle, archive/self-paced copy, desktop/mobile screenshots |
| Source gate | root material moved once, 2025 remains readable, full SHA archive links, archive/file limits and checker report |

## Remaining policy and settled initial defaults

1. Whether self-paced learners may submit/grading/peer review and whether they can earn
   certificates. Until decided, the site offers reading, shared read progress and
   clearly ungraded practice only.
2. Sitemap initial policy: include course/current module/current lesson pages only. Keep cohort operation and archive destinations discoverable through links; adding cohort landings to the sitemap is a later editorial decision and does not block W5.
3. Retain retired shared lesson rows and managed assets through the rollout. Automated deletion/retention cleanup requires a later reviewed policy; it is not part of this implementation and must not create a public historical viewer.
4. Context cache decision: use `private, no-store` for context variants. A future caching optimization is not part of this implementation and must not block it.
5. The operations script authors the source manifest; the website importer is the sole database writer. Use `self-paced` for the initial synthetic fixture; choose real delivery identifiers explicitly during rollout.
